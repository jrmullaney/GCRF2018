  \noindent
  We request funds to extend our previous GCRF-funded project 
  
  research how the data archiving and analysis techniques we have developed as part of our previous STFC/Newton-funded project can be best adapted to address the needs of Thai businesses and organisations. To achieve this research aim, our multi-disciplinary team of Thai and UK scientists will spend 12 months working closely with a group of five pre-identified businesses and organisations based in Northern Thailand that have specific data archiving and analysis needs.

  {\large \bf 1.1 Background: Using astronomy data to train Thai data scientists}
  
  \noindent
  As outlined in our ODA statement, there is strong evidence that improving access to advanced data handling and analysis techniques is one of the most effective ways of increasing productivity in businesses and organisations. This is most sustainable when using home-grown talent to provide these services. As such, providing relevant, high quality training in these digital skills to Thai students and workers is a major element in helping the Thai economy to graduate from middle to upper income. 
  
  Facilitated by STFC funding via the Newton and GCRF programs our team of educators and researchers are developing a highly effective data science training programme for Thai students. As part of this programme, students work with external industries and organisations to gain first-hand experience in using data science to solve real-world problems. The first students involved in our training programme developed novel machine learning-based technologies to identify rare true positive sources within astronomy datasets which contained a much larger (i.e., by a factor of $>1000$) samples of false positives; an example of a heavily imbalanced dataset that off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms struggle to deal with.

  As a consequence of STFC funding (via the GCRF and Newton programs) our team of educators and researchers have been 
  
  Since February, 2017, our team of educators and researchers from multiple disciplines and institutions have been 
  
  
  However, Thai data scientists and their students typically lack access to very large amounts of digital data, restricting their training in ``Big Data'' science that is so crucial for the development of modern economies. To address this problem, we successfully applied for Newton funding (12-month project starting February, 2017) to give the Thai data scientists in our team research experience of working with large amounts of astronomical data generated by the Gravitational-Wave Optical Transient Observatory (GOTO). GOTO surveys the full observable night sky every two weeks, delivering data on roughly seven million astronomical sources {\it every night}. This large, constantly-updated dataset has given our research team the opportunity to develop the skills and techniques needed to handle and analyse the kinds of Big Data generated by many of today's industries.
  
  \vspace{2mm}
  \noindent
  The primary {\it research} goals of our Newton project were to: (a) develop a database that is capable of storing large amounts of data that is updated on a daily basis and (b) develop fully-automated Machine-Learning (ML) algorithms capable of quickly and robustly categorising sources detected by GOTO. Our research has led to some novel solutions. For the database component we are developing a hybrid system that combines the structure of a relational database (such at that used by SDSS) with the flexibility of a non-relational database (which are popular within tech. industries). For the ML component, we are developing a new two-stage categorisation algorithm which uses unsupervised ML algorithms to quickly remove obvious artefacts from our data before passing more ambiguous cases to a supervised ML algorithm. Since both goals are to address challenges associated with archiving and analysing large amounts of astronomical data, the science, technology and expertise involved in the proposed GCRF project has originated from work associated with STFC's core Science Programme. 
  
  \vspace{3mm}
  \noindent
  {\large \bf 1.2 Broadening the impact of our research to local businesses and organisations}
  
  \noindent
  At present, the impact of our Newton project is limited to the people directly involved in the project (i.e., Thai and UK astronomers, Thai data scientists and their students), whereas our long-term ambition has always been to broaden the impact of our research to develop the wider Thai economy. In this regard the goal of this GCRF project is to use the technology and skills we have developed to increase the productivity of Thai businesses and organisations. To do this effectively, our team needs to first gain experience of working with such external parties to research how best to adapt our technologies and expertise to their data handling and analysis needs.  
  
  \vspace{2mm}
  \noindent
  For this partnership-building project, we request funds to research how our data archiving and analysis techniques can be adapted to meet the needs of five pre-identified Thai businesses and organisations (hereafter, ``external partners''; see Table 1). All our external partners are based in areas local to the Thai co-Is and have already agreed to work with us throughout the 12-month project (see Letters of Support). At this ``capacity building'' stage, we prefer to limit the number of external partners as it ensures that all parties have a thorough understanding of the goals and expectations of the project from the outset. In addition to our research goals, our aim is to learn lessons and define commonalities of approach that can be applied when we expand the project to work with larger numbers of external partners. Our ambition is to apply for follow-on GCRF funding to support this expansion.

  {\large \bf 1.3 Description of work to be undertaken}
  
  \noindent
  Over the twelve month period of the grant, we will (in broadly chronological order; see Gantt Chart):
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=6mm,itemsep=-3pt,topsep=1pt]
  \item Have the Thai staff and students currently working on the project visit the UK. The purpose of this visit is provide the students with first-hand experience of presenting to and communicating with their first external partner -- the GOTO collaboration.
  \item Host a networking event in Chiang-Rai, Thailand, where most of the Thai co-Is and external partners are based. All team members and representatives from all external partners will attend. At the event, our team will deliver a series of short presentations to highlight our skills and technology, using GOTO as a case study. Representatives from our external partners will describe their businesses/organisations, the data they hold, and agree with the team their desired outcomes from the project, together with an estimate of their impact.
  \item Each external partner will be assigned at least one primary team member contact (this could be a postgraduate student, in which case a staff researcher will act as a secondary contact). The primary contact will attend on-site fortnightly meetings with the external partner to get to fully understand their data and analysis needs. Such close interaction is vital in order to discriminate between informative vs. non-informative data. After each meeting, the primary contact will report back to the rest of the team to ensure a collaborative effort is maintained. Start researching and testing possible solutions to the external partners' needs.
  \item We will host a second networking event in month 5. By this stage, the team will have a thorough understanding of the data and needs of each external partner and will have researched possible solutions, enabling us to decide on the broad design of what we will deliver to each partner. This design will be discussed and agreed-upon by the external partners during the networking event. 
  \item Our work will focus on delivering the agreed systems by adapting our own and further researching new techniques to meet our partners' needs. As this happens, the purpose of the fortnightly meetings will progressively shift toward feedback sessions, during which the primary contact will demonstrate our systems and allow the end user to suggest improvements. 
  \item At the start of month ten, we will deliver ``Beta versions'' of the systems we have developed. We will train the external partners on how to use the systems and collect any immediate feedback they may have. The systems will then go through a two month-long Beta testing phase by the external partners, who will then report their experience back to the team. During months eleven and twelve we will address any feedback from the Beta testing phase to deliver the final product.
  \item We will host a final networking event to discuss the outcomes, successes/drawbacks, impact-to-date, and future directions of the research and partnerships. This event will coincide with an outreach event to highlight to the public and invited representatives from other businesses/organisations the economic benefits of data science. Part of the goal of this event is to identify future partnerships.

  {\large \bf 1.4 Maximising the impact of the project}
  
  \noindent
  The steps we have taken to ensure that the project has maximal impact are described fully in our Pathways to Impact statement. Briefly, our choice of working very closely with a limited number of external partners is motivated by our desire to focus our efforts to ensure maximal impact in terms of our partners' productivity {\it and} building our team's capacity for working with external partners. This experience will establish protocols and ways of working to be taken forward to future partnerships.

  \vspace{2mm}
  \noindent
  In addition to the impact within Thailand, the project promises secondary benefits to UK research. With STFC's involvement in forthcoming data-intensive projects such as the LSST and SKA, it is vitally important that UK astronomers gain exposure to advanced data handling and analysis techniques. Further, the proposed work will give the team experience of working with data-intensive businesses -- valuable preparation for research supported by the UK Government's Industrial Strategy.
  
  \vspace{3mm}
  \noindent
  {\large \bf 2.1 Management plan}
    
  \noindent
  The success of each external partnership will be a team effort. During and following the first networking event we will set out a series of milestones to reach in order to achieve each partner's desired outcome. After consulting with the rest of the team, Drs. Boongoen and Mullaney will assign primary contacts by matching team members' skills and experience to the needs of the external partners. Dr. Boongoen will coordinate the fortnightly partner meetings. At the end of each of their fortnightly meetings, the primary contact will write a brief meeting summary which will be discussed with, agreed, and signed-off by the external partner. These summaries will be collated and shared among the whole team prior to our fortnightly team meetings/telecons. During our minuted team meetings/telecons we will decide what short term actions should be taken, and by whom, to reach the intermediate milestones and the desired goals of the external partners, and whether any of these need to be reassessed with the partners. By pooling our resources and focussing on a limited number of external partners we mitigate the risk that the needs of any one partner will go unmet. Finalising, during the second networking event, a broad design of what will be delivered for Beta testing avoids the risk of not delivering a coherent system for Beta testing. The design can still evolve after this stage, but this approach ensures any evolution will be managed. There is the risk that an external partner may be unsatisfied with the proposed design of the Beta system. If that happens, it will be the responsibility of Drs. Boongoen and Mullaney (as PIs) to negotiate a solution. Should a viable solution not be found, it is feasible that a partner may leave the collaboration. This risk to the project is mitigated by having multiple partners, while the team would still have learned valuable lessons from the experience to carry-over into future partnerships.

  %The aim of this project is to research how to adapt and build-upon the databasing and machine-learning technologies we have developed to best satisfy the data handling/analysis needs of our five external partners. Our goal is that this research will increase our partners' productivity, which will first be assessed qualitatively via partner feedback then, after 12 months, quantitatively through data analysis. The project is the next step in our long-term ambition to establish a self-sustaining ``Centre of Excellence'' that will deliver data solutions to a wide range of businesses and organisations in northern Thailand.
